        <p>When do cloud bottoms appear like bubbles? Normally, cloud bottoms are flat. This is because moist warm air that rises and cools 
            will condense into water droplets at a specific temperature, which usually corresponds to a very specific height.  
            As water droplets grow, an opaque cloud forms.  Under some conditions, however, cloud pockets can develop that contain large 
            droplets of water or ice that fall into clear air as they evaporate.  Such pockets may occur in turbulent air near a 
            thunderstorm.  Resulting mammatus clouds can appear especially dramatic if sunlit from the side.  The mammatus clouds pictured 
            here, lasting only a few minutes, were photographed over Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, just after a storm in 2012.
